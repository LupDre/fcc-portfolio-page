Portfolio Project for Free Code Camp
---------------------------------

Welcome to my portfolio page!

I created it on CodePen originally, to complete the requirements for an objective on freecodecamp.com and have transferred the code to c9.io to build it as its own site. I was pleased with the design and simple functionality that I am going to use it as my own portfolio.

Please let me know what you think (and what doesn't work, of course).

**CURRENT ISSUES**

c9 is giving me trouble with my jQuery file. I will test once uploaded.

8/2/16 - Site is uploaded but the collapsed navbar button isn't working as the menu is not expanding when the button is clicked.
